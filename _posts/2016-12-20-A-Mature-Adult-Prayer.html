section: Fixed
subSection:
order:
type: petition, refinment
version: 38
note: This prayer is great because the first part is about shutting up about the stuff I already know about to listening. In the second part I listen to trouble and then surprise, the punch line, I report good. This is a prayer about generosity.

<p>
  Give me grace to listen to people.
  Help me see that, good or bad, it is probably not about me.
  And open my eyes when it is.
  Keep me from the habit of speaking on all subjects and at every occasion.
  Teach me the glory that more than occasionally I am mistaken.
  Help we witness their offerings.
  Release me from thinking I can straighten out everyone else's lives.
  Help me trust the expertise of those who live with circumstances, experience, and consequences in their own life.
  Seal my lips on my aches and fears, my hopes and ideas
  - my love of rehearsing them is copious.
  Free me from the recital of needless details
  - give me wings to get to the point.
  Give me grace to listen to the tales of others.
  Help me value familiar blessings and marvel at reliable miracles.
  Help me see good things in unexpected places,
  and talents in unexpected people.
  And most of all, give me, the grace to tell them so.
</P>
