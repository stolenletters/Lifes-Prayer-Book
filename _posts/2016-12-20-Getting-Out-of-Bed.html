<p>Dear Lord,
  So far I've done all right.
  I haven't gossipped, haven't lost my temper,
  haven't been greedy,
  grumpy, nasty,
  selfish,
  or overindulgent.</p>
<p>I'm really glad about that.</p>
<p>And in a few minutes, God,
  I'm going to get out of bed.
  From then on,
  I'm going to need a lot more help.</p>
