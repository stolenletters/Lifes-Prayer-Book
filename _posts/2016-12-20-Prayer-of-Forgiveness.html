<p>I hereby forgive anyone who has angered or troubled me;
anyone who has injured me, physically, financially, in my pride,
or in any other way;
whether the injury was accidental or intentional, whether by word or deed.
Don't punished anyone on my account.</p>
<p>Forgiving frees me.
I want to be free.
If I fail to forgive at this time, I will strive to forgive soon.<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>I am in need of forgiveness from many people for many things.
I hereby ask for forgiveness, from all those I have harmed,
whether the injury was accidental or intentional, whether by word or deed.
Seeking forgiveness and knowing of forgiveness both free me.
I want to be free.
For all the injuries I cannot now ask for forgiveness
because I don't know about the injury
or asking might harm people more
or I am yet unwilling, let those harmed find peace.<sup>2</sup>
I hereby set out to pursue forgiveness,
from all those I have harmed,
whether the injury was accidental or intentional, whether by word or deed.</p>
<p>Transform all misdeeds,
  not through sickness or suffering, but through mighty compassion.
Please, may, I fall short far less;
let me not be a cause of pain, fear, or anger.</P>
