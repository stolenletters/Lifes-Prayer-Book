<p>Life is change and change is hard.<sup>2</sup>
  I am of a nature to change.
  I am of a nature to grow old.
  Old age will embrace me.
  I am of a nature to fall ill.
  Ill health will embrace me.
  I am of a nature to die.
  Death will embrace me.
  The embrace of entropy will change everything I think of as me.
  Do I embrace change?</p>
  <p>I am of a nature to know joy.
  Within me is the capacity to perceive beauty and elegance,
  to be among friends, to feel gratitude and connection.</p>
  <p>Death is certain. Its hour is unknown; what should I do?<sup>3</sup></p>
  <p>This moment is a moment in change.
    Everything I feel in this moment will change.
    Everything I cling to, everything that leads me to suffering and joy,
    it will all change.</p>
  <p>Whatever I do, for good or for ill, everything I do changes me.
    Through my actions I relate; everything I do changes the world I live in.
    From there I go on, child to all I have done,
    born of and in the world of my actions.
    The world I live in changes me.</p>
