<p>I like to think,
  if I just manage well I can get what I want and avoid all hard feelings.
  I have opportunities and disappointments, joys and sorrows,
  together in abundance.
  I like to think if I study diligently I will have clarity and understanding.
  I walk this labyrinth of amazing mystery in insight and misunderstanding.
  I cling to illusions of safety, order, and control.
  I have peace and not safety;
  I flow and balance in order and chaos;
  I have influence and not control.
  When my illusions are stolen, what has been taken from me?
  Am I liberated?
  Take my illusions and open me
  to life messy with love and chaotic with joy.</P>
