<p>Welcome to the laboratory of the spirit.
  For every circumstance, there are proper blessings, wonderful prayers.
  Let us seek them! We will have many ideas for prayers.
  Be merciful with our ignorance;
  take what is right from our words and guide us to them.
  Be adventurous and try them out.</P>
