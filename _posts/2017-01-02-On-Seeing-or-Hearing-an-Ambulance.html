<p>Oh Shit, someone is having a bad day.
  May the fierce, screaming,
  maternal love of our community come to all in need.
  Please protect our messengers on their way.
  Thank you that I do not need an ambulance now.
  Blessed are you, who sustain the living,
  support the fallen,
  heal the sick,
  and keep faith with those who sleep in the dust.<sup>1</sup></p>
