<p>Guardians of justice and liberty, bringers of truth,
  sources of shelter, protectors, and redeemers,
  grant guidance, wisdom, courage, bathed in a deep humanity,
  and a love of peace,
  to the People who promise to uphold the Constitution,
  represent our values,
  to serve and to govern our nation, state, and city,
  our citizens, and all who reside within our borders.
  With honor and integrity,
  lead us to a time when liberty and equality reign supreme,
  bring prosperity to our land, protect our homes,
  and forge a flourishing and peaceful future.
  Grant safety and security to all nations,
  so that truth and harmony will resound from corners of the earth
  for every land and every people.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The President and Vice President of the Union,
  the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America
  in Congress assembled;
  the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor
  and the People of this state
  represented in Senate and assembly and the Magistrates of this City:<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>May the blessing of God rest upon you.
  May divine peace abide with you.
  May the divine presence illuminate your heart.<sup>3</sup></p>
