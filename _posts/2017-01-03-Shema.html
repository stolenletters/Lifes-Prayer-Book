title: Shema <bdi>שְׁמַע</bdi>
source: Jewsih Tradition / bible http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/706162/jewish/Translation.htm 1. Deuteronomy 6:10-12
author:
section: fixed
type: Declaration, Refinement,
version: 38
note: I changed the shema from our children to your children because courts and walls are also possessive. Deuteronomy 6 4-9 I am currently going through an atheist phase so I am playing with other words for "God" my top candidates are Humanity, Children, and Life. See my notes on Mindfulness Trainings, Descendants and "The breath of life sustains me..." in meditations. If I change the language on this message of unity what is left? I am also playing with adding some language from Deuteronomy 6 10-12 "...to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build, houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied, be careful that you do not forget the Lord, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery." Because it is so evocative and because I do in fact live in houses I did not build. That is how community and capitalism works. I live in houses people before me and around me build.

<p>Listen Israel, The Divine, our Humanity, the Divine is one.
  Love humanity with all your heart
  and with all your soul
  and with all your abilities (means).
  These words that I lay upon you today must remain on your heart.
  Teach them to your children,
  talk of them in your home and on the road,
  when you lie down and when you get up.
  Bind these words as a sign on your hand (work),
  and let them be the center of your sight (attention).
  Write them on your doorposts and on your gates (courts).</p>
<p>And it will be,
  even if you will diligently obey the words I lay upon you today,
  to love humanity and to serve humanity
  with all your heart and with all your soul,
  that a gift of rain will come to the land at the proper time,
  the early rain and the late rain,
  and you will gather in grain, wine and oil,
  and a gift of grass will come in your fields for cattle,
  and then when you eat and are sated,
  you will lest your heart be lured away and turn astray.
  And you will live in a land with large flourishing cities you did not build,
  houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide,
  wells you did not dig,
  and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant
  — then when you eat and are satisfied,
  and you think it is by your doing.<sup>1</sup>
  So be careful that you do not forget the givers of gifts,
  who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
  For other times will come when the heavens close when there is no rain
  and the earth will not yield its produce,
  and you will swiftly perish from the good land which you got as a gift.
  Therefore, place these words of Mine upon your heart and upon your soul,
  and bind them for a sign on your hand,
  and they shall be for a reminder between your eyes.
  You shall teach them to your children,
  to speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road,
  when you lie down and when you rise.
  And you shall inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates -
  so that your days and the days of your children may be prolonged
  on the land which has been given you as a gift and inheritance.</p>
<p>God spoke to Moses, saying:
  Speak to the children of Israel and tell them to
  make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments
  throughout their generations,
  and to attach a thread of blue on the fringe of each corner.
  They shall be to you as tzizit,
  and you shall look upon them and remember all the commandments
  you inherited and fulfill them,
  and you will not follow after your heart
  and after your eyes by which you go astray -
  so that you may remember and keep your tradition and be holy.</p>
