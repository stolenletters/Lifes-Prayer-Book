<p>God In the abundance of your kindness I come into your house.
  I love the places where your glory dwells.
  As for me, I will prostrate before you. I will worship.
  May the words of my mouth
  and the meditations of my heart be acceptable.
  In an abundance of love,
  please answer me in truth with salvation.</p>
