WIL: What I like about this prayer when I first read it was that I was to serve all whom I met. I am a service committee responsible to those I meet. I liked the word kneel because, it reminded me of the seen in Lying Awake when the doctor kneels before the nun to test a reflex in her foot and she sees him as Jesus ministering to the feet of others. I changed it because I do not want to feel lower then the people I meet. So I kept it in the title and changed it in the prayer. I love the child like loving in the new words. Now I want both.

<p>Teach me to hold hands with everyone I meet.
  Let me glimpse again
  within our everyday appearance the divine child.<sup>1</sup>
  Let me recognize brothers and sisters our family likeness.
  Teach me to use simple things as the tools of love.
  Give me willingness to do any chore for the sake of love.
  Let me share my toys for joy.
  It is a privilege to help friends. Lets play!</p>
