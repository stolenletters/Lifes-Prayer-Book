<p>Oh Dear gardener, plant us in rich soil, rich with tender mercy.
  Water us in affection, shade us with good company.
  Illuminate us with the warmth of gratitude.
  Tend our sick ones, rest our weary ones;
  bless our dying ones; soothe our suffering ones;
  bolster our afflicted ones; shield our joyous ones;
  so that we can flourish.
  Cultivate our differences so that we show off our best gifts.
  Train our attention to that which support us;
  so that we may grow strong
  and bloom with joy
  and cast seeds of love upon the wind.
  Let joy takes root in ever hart
  and propagate in every rocky place,
  on the hill sides,
  and in the shady groves,
  a bountiful garden, a society of love.</p>
