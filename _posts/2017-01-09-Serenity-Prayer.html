<p>Give us grace to accept with serenity
    the things that cannot be changed,
    Courage to change the things
    which should be changed,
    and the Wisdom to distinguish
    the one from the other.

    Living one breath at a time,
    Enjoying one moment at a time,
    Accepting as a pathway to peace,
    Taking this world as it is,
    Trusting that grace and devotion and truth lead toward right,
    So that we may be reasonably happy in this life.</p>
