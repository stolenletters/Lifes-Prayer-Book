<p>Bless us who set our strength in you; set our hearts on pilgrimage.
  For we take awful refuge in the illusions of safety and control.
  We cling to blindness and refuse to see the dazzling beauties before us.
  We forget and seek shelter in the walls of flimsy houses.
  We are nearsighted and seek prosperity from the work of our hands.
  We think we can secure happiness if only we manage well.
  We are sheltered in peace.
  We are rich in the perfusion of life, the bounties of the earth.
  We find joy keeping this festive day.
  In all that works for our blessing we behold divine love.
  Let us trust in your kindness and delight in your works.
  Thank you for good order,
  which brings ripeness to fruit and joy to the heart that follows it.</p>
