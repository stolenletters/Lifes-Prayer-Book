<p>God here with me,<br>
  before and behind me,<br>
  beneath and above me,<br>
  on my right and left. God in me.<br>
  God where I lie,<br>
  God where I sit,<br>
  God where I arise,<br>
  God in the heart of everyone who thinks of me,<br>
  God in the mouth of every one who speaks to me,<br>
  God in every eye that sees me,<br>
  God in every ear that hears me.<br>
  May your salvation be ever with us.</p>
