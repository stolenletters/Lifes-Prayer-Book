<p>I want to rejoice in the way (Torah), pray without ceasing, and give thanks in all circumstances.<sup>G</sup>
  I want to walk cheerfully over the world answering that of god in everyone.<sup>F</sup>
  Let me pursue our commandments,<sup>E</sup> open my hart to the way (Torah), let me do kindness, love mercy, and walk humbly.<sup>D</sup>
  It is time to give up my hopes for acceptance, my fears of rejection, and love generously.
  Please give me a resigned hart to love generously.</p>
