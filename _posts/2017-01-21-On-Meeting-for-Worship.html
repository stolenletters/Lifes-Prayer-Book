<p>Look about; see the faces of those we know and love,
  neighbors and friends, sisters and brothers, a community of kindred spirits.
  Look about and see the faces of those we hardly know, 
  Strangers, sojourners, and forgotten Friends.
  Let us toss out our assumptions.
  Look about and see those misunderstood,
  judged and judging, fierce, proud and brave.
  Look about and see those who need an outstretched hand and see those offering.
  Let us confess our sins, our failings, our fears,
  our hopes, our desires, one to another. So we may know each other better and enter into sight of the divine.
  Look about and see all the images of God assembled here.
  In me, in you, in each of us, God's spirit shines for all to see.
  People of God, look and see.</p>
<p>Welcome those we know and love,
  neighbors and friends, sisters and brothers, a community of kindred spirits.
  Welcome those we hardly know, 
  Strangers, sojourners, and forgotten Friends.
  Welcome those misunderstood,
  judged and judging, fierce, proud and brave.
  Welcome those who need an outstretched hand and welcome those offering.
  Welcome images of God assembled here.
  People of God, welcome.</p>
