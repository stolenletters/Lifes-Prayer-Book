<p>Look about; see the faces of those we know and love,
  neighbors and friends, sisters and brothers a community of kindred spirits.
  Look about and see the faces of those we hardly know, 
  Strangers, sojourners, and forgotten Friends.
  Toss out our assumptions,
  look about and see those misunderstood,
  judged and judging, fierce, proud and brave.
  Look about and see those who need an outstretched hand and see those offering.
  Let us confess our sins, our failings, our fears,
  our hopes, and courage, our wants, together to enter into the presence.
  Look about and see all the images of God assembled here.
  In me, in you, in each of us, God's spirit shines for all to see.
  People of God, look and see.</p>
<p>Welcome those we know and love,

  Welcome those who need an outstretched hand and welcome those offering.
  Let us confess our sins, our failings, our fears,

  Welcome images of God assembled here.
