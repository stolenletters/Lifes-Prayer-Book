<p>Blessed are you who formed us with wisdom.
  Blessed are you who created within us many openings and cavities,
  organs and senses.
  Thank you for letting me learn about the awesome,
  wondrous, elegant delicate, robustness of your creation;
  Expressed in my body!</p>
<p>Who is like you doer of mighty acts, Master craftsman of human anatomy?</p>
