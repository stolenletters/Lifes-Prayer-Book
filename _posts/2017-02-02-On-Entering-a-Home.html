<p>May your house be a place of happiness for all who enter it,
  a place where the old and the young are renewed in each other's company,
  a place for growing, a place for music, a place for laughter.
  And when shadows and darkness fall within its rooms,
  may it still be a place of hope and strength for all who enter it,
  especially for those who may be entrusted to your care.
  May no person be alien to your compassion.
  May your larger family be the family of all humankind.
  And may those who are nearest to you and dearest to you
  constantly be enriched by
  the beauty and the bounty of your love for each other. (Amen)</p>
