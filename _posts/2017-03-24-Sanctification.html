<p>Come now, poor child,
  turn awhile from business,
  hide yourself for a little time from restless thoughts,
  cast away troublesome cares,
  put aside wearisome distractions.
  Give yourself a little leisure,
  converse with God, and take rest awhile in Him.
  Enter into a secret chamber of your heart:
  leave everything without but God and what may help to seek after Her,
  and when here, then do thou seek.</p>
<p>And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.
  The heavens and the earth were finished,
  the whole host of them.
  God rested from the work of creation and rested from all work.
  God blessed this day, and sanctified it.</p>
  <p>Blessed are you, who create the fruit of the vine.
  Blessed are you, who sanctify us with divine commandments.
  In your pleasure with us, you have lovingly given us an inheritance of Shabbat.
  Shabbat is first among our holy days,
  a remembrance of creation and our exodus from slavery.
  Blessed are you, who sanctify the Shabbat.</p>
