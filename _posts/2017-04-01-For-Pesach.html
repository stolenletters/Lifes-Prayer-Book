<p>When the opportunity to follow the divine comes,
  as it did for me and as it does for everyone of us,
  when the opportunity comes,
  there may be no time to cook dinner,
  no grantee of safety,
  no way of knowing how far there is to go or how to get there.
  We are children of ones who followed the call.
  I am here, doing this to celebrate what following the divine has done for me.
  If you separate yourself from the blessings of community
  you are cut off from connection to the spirit.</p>
