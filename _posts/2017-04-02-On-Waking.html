<p>There is a time to rest and a time to wake.
  Now is the time to wake.
  Welcome new day, magnificent gift for me.
  Thank you once again for placing my soul within me,
  great is your faith in me.
  Thank you for my life this morning;
  for sleep that has refreshed me;
  and a new beginning.</p>
