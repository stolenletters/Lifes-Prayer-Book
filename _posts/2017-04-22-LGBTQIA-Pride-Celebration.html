<p>Those who were oppressed have brought forth a message of celebration,
  acceptance, and healing.
  Thank you for helping me.
  Thank you for thinking I am sexy and telling me so.
  Thank you for giving me a chance to be useful.
  Thank you for teaching me that sex and desire are a good gift to all persons.
  Helping to correct for the shaming view that I so often hear and tell;
  and that rots me from the insides.</p>
