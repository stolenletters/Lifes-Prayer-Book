note: Some of the great things about this prayer is that once you remove the whole king of the universe thing the first three blessings are thanksgiving and prayer too yeast and fruit trees.

<p>(Over wine) Blessed are you, creator of the fruit of the vine.
(Over spices) Blessed are you, creator of all kinds of spices.
(Over the candle) Blessed are you, creator of the lights of fire.
Blessed are you, who distinguishes between sacred and ordinary,
between light and darkness,
between the seventh day and the six days of creation.
Blessed are you, who distinguishes between sacred and ordinary.
(Sip the wine, extinguish the candle and read the following)
Teach us to distinguish between the commonplace and the holy:
teach us to delight in sacred and ordinary, in rest and creation.</p>
