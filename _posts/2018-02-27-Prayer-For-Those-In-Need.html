<p>Let us pray for all us whose pain and misery comes to us

The group’s response will be:
“We pray”

for the those of us who are starving,
for those who are without adequate shelter,
for those who lack clothing,
for those whose human rights are ignored,
for all of us who suffer from illness,
for refugees those of us who have had to flee from their lands,
for all of us who are chronically hungry,
for greater action by those of us who can act,
for all of us who have to live with injustice,
for those of us who have seldom known peace,
for all of us who have lost hope,
for those of us who harden their hearts against the poor,
for the unity of the human family.

May your mercy be on all of us,
as we search for better ways to heal and serve.
Give us insight, sensitivity, creativity, strength and courage
as we seek together a better world.
</p>
