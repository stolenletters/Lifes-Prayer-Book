<p>
Today I have a new commitment to live honestly with myself, as best I can. 
Having imperfect progress, I am gentle with shortcomings, letting go, 
today, of sesntments and wrongs, to care for myself. 
Treating myself with dignity I do in fact deserve because 
today I live honest with myself a difficult and noble endeavor. 
I am proud of me.
