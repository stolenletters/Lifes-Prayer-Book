note: I think about the musem Hitler wanted built of the Jews after he kissed us all. Is that what we are doing with peoples exterminated in North America? This tinges an other wise great holiday for me. The Native Americans gave the pilgrims food, allowing the pilgrims to survive, and hastening the genocide of there own people. Our celebration of their gifts is weird. As Mom say's "No good deed goes unpunished."

<p>This is a festival too celebrate our joys and give thanks for them. 
We are blessed with food and with freedom.
We live in peace and prosperity made possible by stability, 
infrastructure, and protection given by our government. 
We eat grapes from vines we did not plant. 
We are given gifts for which we have not worked. 
And we hardly notice. 
In all that works for our blessing we behold divine love. 
Bless those who give to us.
