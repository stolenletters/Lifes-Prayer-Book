<p>Blessed are You, for allowing me to rejoice on this day of Hanukkah, 
the holiday of our liberation, 
the holiday of our return to the way of our fathers. 
Blessed are You, who allow me to light these candles. 
May you allow me to share the light of the Hanukkah candles many times in our homeland, 
Jerusalem, with my family and friends.</p>
