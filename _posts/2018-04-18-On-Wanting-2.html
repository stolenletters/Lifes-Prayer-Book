<p>Let our herds be so numerous that they cannot be housed. 
Let our children be so abound that the care of them shell overwhelm us. 
Let our heads ever strike against innumerable brass pots hanging from our roofs. 
Let the rats form their nests of shreds of scarlet cloth and silk. 
We are ignorant of what it is good to ask for. 
You know what is good for us. Give it to us!</p>
