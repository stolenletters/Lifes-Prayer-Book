      <h1>Call Me</h1>
      <div><p>You call me with responsibility to love.
  And yet, while being called, I have been unfair and unkind.
  I turned away from your suffering far to many times.
  You direct me to look to people whose need make my self-pity a mockery and a disgrace.
  And I've added to their misfortune and to misunderstanding you.
  I haven't been able to make what I do look at all nice or proper.
  So you call me with love to responsibility.
  You have service, work for me.</p>
