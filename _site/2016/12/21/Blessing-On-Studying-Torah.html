      <h1>Blessing on Studying Torah</h1>
      <div><p>Blessed are all who sanctifies us with practices
  and asked us to engross ourselves in the words of the Torah.</P>
<p>The sages ask why "la'asok"("<bdi>לַעֲסוֹק</bdi>")
  rather than "lomed" ("<bdi>לוֹמד</bdi>": to learn, to study) in this blessing.
  They answer that while not everyone has the time or energy to study the Torah,
  everyone can attend to, be engaged in the Torah.
  For me the reason is because learning implies finishing in knowing.
  We should not feel like we are going to finish and know the Torah.
  When you engage or immerse your self in something
  when you are done you are more connected,
  more engaged then when you started.</p>
