  Let us blessed those whose food we have eaten
and through whose goodness we live.</p>
<h2>First Blessing</h2>
<p>Bless you who provides food for the entire world
in goodness, with grace, kindness, and mercy.
Who supplies sustenance for all living beings,
Because of whose great goodness,
we have never lacked food.
Who is good to all and who supplies food
for all creatures which he brought into being.
Blessed, you, who provides food for all.</p>
<h2>Second Blessing</h2>
<p>We thank you, for giving the heritage to our ancestors
of a lovely, fine and spacious land,
and for having brought us out from Egypt,
for rescuing us from slavery,
and also for a covenant which we sealed in our flesh,
as well as for Torah which you taught us,
laws of which you told us,
and for the life, grace and kindness you have granted us,
and for the sustenance which  you supply and provide for us constantly,
every day, all the time, and at every breath.</p>
<p>So for everything, we thank you and bless you
may your name be blessed in the speech of all living beings,
constantly, for all time.
For it is written: "And you shall eat, and be satisfied, and bless
the God for the good land."
Bless you, for the land and for the food.</p>
<h2>Third Blessing</h2>
<p>Have mercy,
on Israel our people,
on Jerusalem,
on Zion the home of your glory,
on the kingdom of the house of David, Your anointed one,
and on the great and holy house which is called by Your name.</p>
<p>Look after us and feed us,
give us a livelihood to support us,
provide a respite for us,
a respite soon, from our troubles.</p>
<p>And please, let us not be dependent, neither on a gift, nor on a loan,
but rather on a full, open, holy, and generous hand,
so that we should never feel embarrassed or ashamed.</p>
<h2 class="instructions">Special Section for Shabbat</h2>
<p>Give us strengthen through our commandments,
especially on this great and holy Shabbat.
For this is indeed a great and holy day for us;
to rest and be at ease,
with loving concern for the command of the Torah.</p>
<p>So please grant us rest,
with no trouble, or unhappiness, or weeping on our day of rest.
And let us witness, the consolation of Zion,
and the building up of Jerusalem, a holy city,
for that would be redemption, and consolation.</p>
<h2 class="instructions">Special Section for New Month and Holidays</h2>
<p>May the remembrance and mindfulness of us and of our ancestors,
  of Jerusalem, and of all the house of Israel,
  be a heritage for us and a reminder of acceptance, mercy, and kindness,
  life and peace, on this day of<br>

<h2>Fourth Blessing</h2>
<p>Bless you our Holy One, the Holy One Jacob,
our Shepherd, the Shepherd of Israel
who does good to all,
who every day,
has been good, is good and will be good to us.

Bless you who gave, gives, and will give us
grace, kindness, and mercy,
and respite, deliverance, and success, blessing
and salvation, comfort, a livelihood and sustenance,
and life and peace and everything that is good.
Please may we never lack anything that is good.</p>
<p>May the Merciful One rule over us.
May the Merciful One be blessed in heaven and on earth.
May the Merciful One be praised for generation upon generation,
and may Merciful One be glorified through us,
and may Merciful One be honored through us.
May the Merciful One grant us an honorable livelihood.
May the Merciful One break the yoke from our neck
and lead us upright to our land.
May the Merciful One send a plentiful blessing on this house
and on this table at which we have eaten.
May the Merciful One send us Elijah the prophet who is remembered for good
who will bring us good tidings of salvation and comfort.</p>
