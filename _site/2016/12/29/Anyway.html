      <h1>Anyway</h1>
      <p>We are often unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered.
  Forgive anyway.
  We are sometimes jealous of happiness.
  Be happy anyway.
  We cheat and are cheated.
  Be honest anyway.
  In kindness we sometimes make accusations of selfishness and ulterior motives.
  Be kind anyway.
  In success and vulnerability,
  we sometimes make and are enemies and false friends.
  Succeed and be tender anyway.
  The good we do today will be forgotten tomorrow.
  Do good anyway.
  What we spend years building could be destroyed overnight.
  Build anyway.
  In responsibility, friendship, and love,
  we often fail, disappear, we hurt and bitterly disappoint.
  Forgive, grow, and return to responsibility and love.<sup>1</sup>
  The best we have, may not be adequate.
  Give anyway.</p>
