      <h1>A Pagan Prayer</h1>
      <p>I am hungry and you nourish me,
  I am naked and you clothed me,
  I was ostracised and you welcomed me in.
  Plants whose lives I take, animals whose deaths I cause:
  Come, we will live our lives together now, you in me.
  You are one who gives me life.
  A parent to me.
  Bless you who nourish my body and spirit.
  I offer you hospitality of my home.
  You are welcome here.
  My eating is a rite of praise of you and life.</p>
<p>This food is the work of many.
  Before eating, it is right to acknowledge their labor.
  All our ancestors, numinous ones (of earth and sky), thank you.
  My eating is a rite of praise for all you have done.</p>
<p>My life is a memorial to you.
  May my life, lived in sacred order, be a credit to you.
  May you be honored by my life. Holy Ones, please receive this offering.
  My eating of it is a rite of praise for all you have done.</p>
