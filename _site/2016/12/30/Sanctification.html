      <h1>Sanctification</h1>
      <div><p>Come now, poor child,
  turn awhile from your business,
  hide yourself for a little time from restless thoughts,
  cast away troublesome cares,
  put aside wearisome distractions.
  Give yourself a little leisure to converse with the Devine,
  take thy rest awhile in Him.
  Enter into the secret chamber of your heart:
  leave everything without but God and what may help to seek after Her,
  and when you have settled, then do seek.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Blessed are you, who create the fruit of the vine.
  Blessed are you, who sanctify us with divine commandments,
  you have lovingly given us an inheritance of the Holy Shabbat.
  To give such a gift you must be pleased with us.
  Shabbat is first among our holy days,
  in memory of creation and a remembrance of our exodus from Egypt.
  Blessed are you, who sanctify the Shabbat.</p>
