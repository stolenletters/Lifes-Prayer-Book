      <h1>We feast in praise</h1>
      <div><p>From God comes the warm sun, the cool rain, and the rich soil
God causes the tree to bear fruit and the earth to yield vegetables.
From God comes the wisdom by which we plant and harvest.
From God comes the mysterious chemistry of growth
God causes the bread to rise, cheese to curdle and wine to ferment.
From God comes the striving to live and the time to die
Thank you for the good earth and it's blessings.
Thank you for vineyards  and for all who tend them.
Thank you for natureâ€™s order,
which brings ripeness to the earth and joy to the heart,
hunger and satiation.</p>

  <p>Notes: Yaacov suggested that the Jewish blessings over food are carefully phrased to praise parts of the process that are not done by humans. We can plant vegetables and we can water them we can not make them grow.</p>
