      <h1>Teach me to kneel</h1>
      <p>Teach me to hold hands with everyone I meet.
  Let me glimpse again
  within our everyday appearance the divine child.<sup>1</sup>
  Let me recognize brothers and sisters our family likeness.
  Teach me to use simple things as the tools of love.
  Give me willingness to do any chore for the sake of love.
  Let me share my toys for joy.
  It is a privilege to help friends. Lets play!</p>
