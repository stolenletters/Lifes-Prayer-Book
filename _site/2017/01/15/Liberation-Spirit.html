      <div><p>O Liberation Spirit, un-bind, un-fear, un-scorch, un-sear our souls;
  renew us in your free Spirit.
  We're leaning on you, our Tower of Strength.
  We find our refuge in the shade of your shelter.
  Lead us from this place
  - strong -
  to bring forth the power of your love, wherever we are.</p>
