      <h1>With God</h1>
      <p>God here with me,
  before and behind me,
  beneath and above me,
  on my right and left. God in me.
  God where I lie,
  God where I sit,
  God where I arise,
  God in the heart of everyone who thinks of me,
  God in the mouth of every one who speaks to me,
  God in every eye that sees me,
  God in every ear that hears me.
  May your salvation be ever with us.</p>
