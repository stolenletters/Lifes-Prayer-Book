      <h1>On Letting Things Go</h1>
      <div><p>Thank you for all you have done for me.
  Thank you for bringing ______  or allowing me to ______.
  You have served you purpose for me.</p>
<p class="note">For a time I was interested in the idea of ceaseless prayer.
  It seems to me that one way to approach this is to keep adding prayers
  for more and more things until you are praying all the time. </p>
  <p class="note">In "The gratitude diaries:
    how a year looking on the bright side can transform your life.",
    Janice Kaplan looks for what she can buy to be grateful for.
    Her experience parallels research studies
    that show money and possessions do not add much to happiness.
    I think Ms Kondo offers the solution.
    It is not by adding to our possessions that we become grateful and happy;
    it is by appreciating the ones we have more.</p>
