      <h1>The Universe is conspiring to shower us with blessings</h1>
      <div><p>I'm happy to announce this perfect moment;
  inspires me to say a gigantic prayer for all of us.
  I am roused to unleash a divinely greedy,
  apocalyptically healing prayer for each and every one of us
  - especially those of us who don't believe in the power of prayer.</p>
<p>Dear Goddess, sweet Goddess,
  sly Universal beautiful Woman,
  Mother of All Creation,
  Girlfriend of God,
  Wise Crone,
  may my exuberant,
  suave and fortuitous words move us to shower
  ferocious blessings down on everyone.</p>
<p>Sweet Goddess, many of us divine chameleons here
  don't know that we are all different from what we think we are
  and more exciting than we can possibly imagine.
  So please use blinding magic to help us see that
  we are all wildly creative too big for our own personalities.
  Who are we, born to make manifest the Goddesses glory,
  not to be brilliant, gorgeous, handsome, talented, and fabulous?<sup>1</sup>
  Rouse the Wild Woman within us.
  Brainwash us with the freedom to see and change.</p>
<p>Sly Universal beautiful Woman,
  we give so much love and pain mixed together that
  our morality is always on the verge of collapsing.
  Remove, banish, annihilate and laugh into oblivion any jinx
  that has clung to us or we participated in,
  no matter how long we've suffered from it,
  even if we've become accustomed or addicted to its ugly companionship.
  Make it unpalatable, unappealing, irrelevant,
  unpatriotic and totally tasteless
  for us to be in love with anyone or anything that's no good with us.
  And please conjure an aura of protection around us so that
  we will receive an early warning
  if we are ever about to act in such a way as to bring another hex
  or plague or voodoo into our lives in the future.
  Cast a huge-assed love spell that will nullify all the dumb ideas,
  bad decisions and nasty conditioning that have ever
  cursed us wise and sexy virtuosos.</p>
<p>Mother of All Creation, Provoke us to throw away
  all that encourage us to believe that we are better than anyone else.
  Awaken us so that we never count our own feelings more than anyone else's.
  Inspire us compassionate rascals communing with this prayer to
  love our enemies so we have more and better friends.</p>
<p>Girlfriend of God, source of the fiercely tender, hauntingly reassuring,
  orgiastically sacred feeling
  that is even now running through all of our soft, warm animal bodies:
  I pray that we provide everyone out there with a
  license to bend and even break all unholy rules,
  laws and traditions that keep us apart from love and loving.</p>
<p>Wise Crone, the curiously divine beings reading this prayer
  deserve everything we are yearning for and much, much more.
  Show us how to purge the wishy-washy wishes
  that distract us from our dramatic, daring, divine desires.
  Guide us to bigger, better, more original sins
  and wilder, more interesting problems.
  Give us the boons we think we need,
  everything we've always been afraid to imagine or ask for
  and what we don't even know we want.</p>
<p>So please bless us with lucid dreams while we are wide-awake
  and vacuum cleaners for our magic carpets
  and a knack for avoiding hells
  and please bless us with admirers who are not psychotic stalkers.</p>
<p>And now dear I bring this prayer to a close,
  trusting that in these mysterious moments we have begun to change,
  everyone out there in the exact way we've needed to change.</P>
<p>Amen. Awomen. And glory halle-friggin-lujah.
  Abundant Blessings and Fairy Dust Sprinkles...</p>
