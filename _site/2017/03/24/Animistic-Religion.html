      <div><p>Thank you ______, who have provided for my hunger,
  you have sacrificed for my comfort and well-being.
  Forgive me for killing you, Brother. I grieve for you and honor you.
  And I grieve for your mothers for giving one of her children.
  Now I too am one you have nourished; you are a parent to me.</p>

  <p>Notes: Each religion has a different understanding and relationship to the divine. In animistic religion one prays spirit to spirit as one might talk or bargain with any other neighbor. This experience of empathy strikes me as most profound when praying for food. Asking my food to sacrifice itself for me, thanking it's mother for her child's life. Now that we don't know the apple tree are we orphans? We have stopped doing animal sacrifices; we have forgotten the sacredness of every barbeque. We would do better to see every meal as a sacrifice. Is it more cruel to sacrifice animals to the divine or to eat animals without acknowledging the sacred. We have lost something of the holy order by allowing meals to become entirely practical matters.</p>
