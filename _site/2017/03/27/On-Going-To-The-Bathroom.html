      <h1>On Going To The Bathroom</h1>
      <div><p>Blessed are you who formed me with wisdom
  and created within me many openings and many organs.
  If certain of them were open that should be blocked
  or blocked that should be open
  it would be impossible to stand before You.
  Blessed are you, who crates all flesh to act wondrously.</p>
