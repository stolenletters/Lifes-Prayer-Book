      <h1>I Find My Joy in the Simple Things</h1>
      <div><p>I find my joy in the simple things, coming from the earth.<br>
I find my joy in the sun that shines and the water that sings to me.<br>
<br>
Listen to the wind and listen to the water, hear what they say.<br>
<br>
Singing hey yah hey yah hey yah hey yah hey yah hey yah ho
X3 <br>

Let us never forget, never forget to give thanks, <br>
Give thanks, give thanks, give thanks, and praise <br>
X2 <br>
for the joy that we share
for the love that we share
for the love we recive

Singing hey yah hey yah hey yah hey yah hey yah hey yah ho
X3</p>

<p>Who brings forth bread from the earth.</p>
<p>Who creates various kinds of sustenance.</p>
<p>Who creates the fruit of the vine.</p>
<p>who creates the fruit of the tree.</p>
<p>who creates the fruit of the earth</p>
<p>by Whose word all things came to be.</p>
<p>Creator of numerous living beings and their needs,
  for all the things You have created
  with which to sustain the soul of every living being.
  Blessed is He who is the Life of the worlds.</p>
