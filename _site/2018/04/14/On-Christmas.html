      <h1>On Christmas</h1>
      <div><p>With every new baby, with the inspiration for every new salvation, 
let us set aside our daily concerns to celebrate the birth of hope. 
Let us make the most of the joys of children and family.</p>
<p>Christmas is here because it is unavoidable. Many people complain that Christmas has lost its true meaning.
I think it is about the birth of hope. Knowing that hope will be crushed and born again,
the beginning of a new hope is still wonderful. 
It is the story of how a helpless baby, born in unfortuante circumstances, 
a long time ago, could be of such importance even today. 
It is also one of the few days that almost all other activity stops.
