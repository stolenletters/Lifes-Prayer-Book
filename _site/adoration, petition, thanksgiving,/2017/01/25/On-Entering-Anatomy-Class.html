  Blessed are you who created within us many openings and cavities,
  organs and senses.
  Thank you for letting me learn about the awesome,
  wondrous, elegant delicate, robustness of your creation;
  Expressed in my body!</p>
<p>Who is like you doer of mighty acts, Master craftsman of human anatomy?</p>
