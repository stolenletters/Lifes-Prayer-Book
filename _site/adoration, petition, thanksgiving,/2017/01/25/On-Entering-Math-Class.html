      <h1>On entering math class</h1>
      <p>We look on your workings and grow in knowledge of you and them.
  With the thoughts in our heads,
  the fruits of our imagination,
  we are carried beyond wall and across the boundaries of time and space.
  We look on the stars of our heavens and know their distance and size
  and the order of their moving.
  Still we can count them all the days of all our lives
  and never know their end.
  We look with our mind where our eyes cannot see.
  We study carefully, look as deeply as we can,
  and learn more about the awesome expanse of creation.</p>
