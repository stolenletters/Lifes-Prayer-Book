      <h1>Welcome to my Prayerbook</h1>
      <p>I am a middle aged, white, Jewish, Atheist, liberal, conservative, straight,
  sex positive, American, male, human. And this is my prayer book.
  I collected prayers from many sources. I edited them and re-edited them to
  make them more sacred and dear to me. I changed things haphazardly, what ever
  seemed necessary to make me comfortable with the prayer, or seemed to make
  the prayer clearer to me or more poignant. Some I have barely touched others
  have been altered beyond all recognition. Do not be fooled into thinking you
  have a sense for the original by reading what I have here. I have attempted
  to make attribution to the original author when I can.</p>
<p>Some principles do seem to have emerged. I prefer the language of "I", "we",
  and "and" to "you", "them", and "but". I use the word "Way" for "Torah". I
  prefer to skip naming God, where I can, implying a direct conversation and
  not dealing with the issues of God's identity, gender, or nature. As a
  sometimes atheist, I love when this adds ambiguity about who I am praying to.
  Having played with this prayer book for more then a few years my hopes of
  reaching some end point have faded. More and more I see this as conversation
  with myself and with the divine. Wrestling with concepts that unsettle me.
  Letting me change them and them change me, free from having to settle on a
  conclusion. I offer them to you that you may enjoy the liberation that I
  have found. I encourage you to write prayers that will offend and inspire me.
  I eagerly await them.</p>
<p>This prayerbook is edited by me for me. I hope soon to allow people to
  comment on the prayers I have collected and the changes I have made.
  If you would like a prayerbook of your own, I encourage you to start one.
  If you like what I have here you can make a clone or branch of your own.
  If you are willing please share yours with me.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely<br>
Chaim Finkelman, Student / Editor<p>
