      <h1>Welcome</h1>
          <h2>Welcome to my Prayerbook</h2>
    <p>I am a middle aged, white, Jewish, Atheist, liberal, conservative,
      straight, sex positive, American, male, human.
      And this is my prayer book.
      I collected prayes from many soruces.
      I edited them and reedited them to make them more sacred and dear to me.
      I changed things haphazardly,
      what ever seemed necessary to make me comfortable with the prayer,
      or seemed to make the prayer clearer to me or more poignant.
      Some principles do seem to have emerged.
      I prefer the language of "I", "we", and "and" to "you", "them", and "but".
      I use the word "Way" for "Torah".
      I prefer to skip naming God, where I can,
      implying a direct conversation
      and not dealing with the issues of God's identity,
      gender, or nature. As a sometimes atheist,
      I love when this adds ambiguity about who I am praying to.
      Having played with this prayer book for more then a few years my hopes of
      reaching some end point have faded. More and more I see this as
      conversation with myself and with the divine.
      Wrestling with concepts that unsettle me.
      Letting me change them and them change me,
      free from having to settle on a conclusion.
      I offer them to you that you may enjoy the liberation that I have found.
      I encourage you to write prayers that will offend and inspire me.
      I eagerly await them.</p>

    <p>Yours Sincerely<br>Chaim Finkelman, Student</p>

    <p>"My choices are limited by what is,
      and within that I am freer than I can possibly imagine.""</p>

    <p>"Help me value familiar blessings and marvel at reliable miracles.
      Help me see good things in unexpected places,
      and talents in unexpected people.
      And most of all, give me, the grace to tell them so."</p>
