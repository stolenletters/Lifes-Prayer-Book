      <h1>On traveling</h1>
      <p>Please rescue me from the hand of every foe,
  from every hazard along the way.
  Guide my footsteps in gladness,
  and lead me to peace in my destination.
  May you send blessing in my doings.
  Grant grace, kindness,
  and mercy in your eyes and in the eyes of all who see me.
  Blessed are you, who hear prayer.</p>
