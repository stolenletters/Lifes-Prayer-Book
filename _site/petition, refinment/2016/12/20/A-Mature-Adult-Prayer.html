      <h1>A Mature Adult Prayer</h1>
      <p>Give me grace to listen to other people.
  Help me see that, good or bad, it is probably not about me.
  And open my eyes when it is.
  Release me from thinking I can straighten out everyone elses lives.
  Help me trust that the person who lives with the proble, upset,
  and consequences is probably best suited to navigate and learn from them.
  Teach me the glory that more than occasionally I am mistaken.
  Keep me from the habit of speaking on all subjects and at every occasion.
  Seal my lips on my aches and fears, my hopes and ideas
  - my love of rehearsing them is copious.
  Free me from the recital of needless details
  - give me wings to get to the point.
  Give me grace to listen to the tales of others.
  Help me value familiar blessings and marvel at reliable miracles.
  Help me see good things in unexpected places,
  and talents in unexpected people.
  And most of all, give me, the grace to tell them so.</P>
